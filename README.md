# Integrating Aqua Security with Ticketing and Collaboration Systems #
Use this project to integrate Aqua with JIRA, Email, Slack, Microsoft Teams and ServiceNow systems and create ticket or send a message/email when new vulnerabilities are found in an image.

------

When this integration is enabled, a ticket is opened, or an email or message is sent, with information about the vulnerabilities found in the image. In case of a rescan - a new ticket will be opened, or ticket/message will be sent, only if there are new vulneraibilities that are found in the image rescan.

# Quick Start #
Follow these steps to set up JIRA integration:

1. Get the connection details for your Jira, Slack or SMTP email server
2. Edit the configuration file (cfg.yaml) with the connection details.
3. Run the Aqua ALM Integration container with the configuration file.
4. Configure the Aqua Server to send a Webhook notification when a new vulnerability is found.
5. Validate that a ticket has been opened, or email was sent (depending on your configuration file).

The following sections describe these steps in more detail.

## Getting the JIRA connection details
Login to Jira.
Go to the user profile API tokens (JIRA Cloud users can find it here: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
Click on the Create API Token. A new API token for the user is created.
Keep the token value, together with the JIRA URL and user name, for the next step.

## Getting the Slack connection details
Open your Slack client, "Settings & Administration" -> "Manage Apps".
Go to "Custom Integations", "Incoming Webhooks", "Add to Slack".
Choose a chanel to send the Slack notifications to.
Click "Add Incoming Webhook". Copy the WebHook URL.

## Set up the Configuration File

To set up the integration, you will  need to create a cfg.yaml file, which contains the connection settings.

The below example is to setup a JIRA integration: 

```yaml
---
- name: my-jira
  type: jira
  enable: true
  url: https://myname.atlassian.net
  user: user@gmail.com
  password: XXXXXXXXXXX
  project_key: #Provide here the JIRA project key, e.g., VUL
  board: #Optional JIRA board key, e.g., SLK
  priority: #Optional ticket priority, e.g., High
  assignee: $Optional assignee, e.g., John
  issuetype: $Optional issue type, e.g., Bug
  labels: #Optional comma seperated list of labels that will be assigned to ticket, e.g., ["label1", "label2"]
  sprint: #Optional Sprint name, e.g., "3.5 Sprint 8"
  unknowns: #optional custom fields. Replace the "custom-field" text with the field name in JIRA
     custom-field: #text value, e.g. "hello world"
     custom-field-numeric-field: #numeric value, e.g. 337
     custom-field-multiple-value: #multi value, e.g., 1,2,3 (must be separated by commas)
     custom-field-multiple-line-text-field: #multi line text value, e.g. "text \n moretext" (quotes are mandatory for this field)
     custom-field-date-time-picker: #date and time value, e.g. 2014-04-11T12:14:26.880+0400
     custom-field-url: #URL value, e.g., https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/7
```

See the buttom of this page for other integration types and their parameters.

###### *To prevent providing clear text passwords in text file you can pass an environment variable, e.g. $MY_PASSWORD.
You will need to make sure this environment variable value is passed to the container.

## Run the Aqua ALM Integration Container

Build and run the Aqua Webhook Server container on the same host where the JIRA configuration file is located, as follows:

```bash
docker build -t alm-integration-image:latest .

docker run -d --name=aqua-webhook -v /<path to configuration file>/cfg.yaml:/config/cfg.yaml -e AQUAALERT_CFG=/config/cfg.yaml -e AQUAALERT_URL=0.0.0.0:8084 -e AQUAALERT_TLS=0.0.0.0:8444 -p 8444:8444 -p 8084:8084 alm-integration-image:latest

```

###### *There is a volume mount that mounts the configuration file from the host to the container. There is also an environment variable, AQUAALERT_CFG, that specifies the location of the JIRA configuration file inside the container.*


## Configure the Aqua Server with Webhook Integration

You can configure the Aqua Server to send a Webhook notification whenever a new vulnerability is found.
Navigate to the **Settings** page in the System section, menu, under the "Image Scan Results Webhook" section.

Click "Enable sending image scan results to webhook", and specify the URL of the Aqua Webhook server.

The URL is in the following formats:
**HTTPS**: https://<Webhook IP or DNS>:8444
or
**HTTP**: http://<Webhook IP or DNS>:8084

## Validate the Integration

To validate that the integration is working, you can scan a new image for security vulnerabilities from the Aqua Server UI (Images > Add Image > Specify Image Name > Add).

When vulnerabilities are found in an image, you will see that a JIRA ticket is created/ Email is recieved/ Slack message is posted to the channel.

###### *To troubleshoot the integration, you can look at both the Aqua ALM Integration container logs and the Aqua Server logs. Use the "docker logs <container name>" command to view these logs.*

# Integration Settings
You can setup integrations through the cfg.yaml file. Note that one yaml file can contain multiple integrations (e.g. multiple email integrations, where each integation is handeling different container imgage registry).

The following are the cfg.yaml parameters that apply for all integrations:
Key | Description | Possible Values
--- | --- | ---
name | The integration name. You can provide any descriptive name |
type | The integration type | jira, email, slack, serviceNow, teams
enable | Whether integration is enable or not | true, false
Policy-Min-Vulnerability| Optional: the minimum vulnerability severity that triggers the integation | critical, high, medium, low
Policy-Registry | Optional: the list of registry name that triggers the integration | 
Policy-Image-Name | Optional: comma separated list of images that will trigger the integration
Policy-Only-Fix-Available | Optional: trigger the integration only if image has a vulnerability with fix available (true). If set to false, integration will be triggered even if all vulnerabilities has no fix available | true, false
Policy-Non-Compliant | Optional: trigger the integration only for non-compliant images (true) or all images (false) | true, false
Ignore-Registry | Optional: comma separated list of registries that will be ignored by the integration
Ignore-Image-Name |  Optional: list of comma separated images that will be ignored by the integration

## ServiceNow integration parameters

For Jira you can also specify custom fields that will be populated with values.
Use the "unknowns" parameter in cfg.yaml for custom fields.
Under the "unknowns" parameter, specify the list of fields names to provide value for.
You can add "-numeric-field", "-multiple-value", "multiple-line-text-field", "-date-time-picker" and "-field-url" as suffix to the custom field name, to specify what is the field type.

For example: 
```yaml
unknowns:
     mycustom: "this is a text custom field"
     mycustom-numeric-field: 123
     mycustom-multiple-value: 1,2,3 
     mycustom-multiple-line-text-field: "text \n moretext"
